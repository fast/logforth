/// A guard that flushes log records associated with a [`NonBlocking`] writer on drop.
///
/// Writing to a [`NonBlocking`] writer will **not** immediately write the log record to the
/// underlying output. Instead, the log record will be written by a dedicated logging thread at
/// some later point. To increase throughput, the non-blocking writer will flush to the underlying
/// output on a periodic basis rather than every time a log record is written. This means that if
/// the program terminates abruptly (such as through an uncaught `panic` or a `std::process::exit`),
/// some log records may not be written.
///
/// Since logs near a crash are often necessary for diagnosing the failure, `WorkerGuard` provides a
/// mechanism to ensure that _all_ buffered logs are flushed to their output. `WorkerGuard` should
/// be assigned in the `main` function or whatever the entrypoint of the program is. This will
/// ensure that the guard will be dropped during an unwinding or when `main` exits successfully.
